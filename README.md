# Coupon-recommendation-system
# Abstract:
E-Coupons are used to reduce the price of a product or products that customers purchase from any online website, making it more useful for consumers as well. 
Our project is based on user data analysis which is used to predict the past purchase of coupons and recommend the coupons to purchase based on the past behaviour.
Issuing discount shopping coupons and barter purchase is a popular way to promote sales in E-commerce environments.
 To treat the coupon redemption probability prediction problem as a binary classification problem, we use machine learning methods to analyse users' coupon usage behaviour and coupon purchase prediction.![image](https://github.com/SanthoshiGanthala/Coupon-recommendation-system/assets/128204152/32dfed35-b9c9-4eb4-8903-7c587c115858)
